Hist should use an underlying vector object, not vector pointer

Add move constructor for Hist:
  Hist(Hist&& h);
  static Hist& operator=(Hist&& h);

Add Hist::plotFunction
  static Hist plotFunction(double left, double right, function<double, double> f, int nbins = 100)

Make Event iterable by adding the following methods:
  vector<Particle>::iterator begin() { return entry.begin(); }
  vector<Particle>::iterator end()   { return entry.end();   }

Don't include Pythia8/Pythia.h in HIUserHooks
  When doing so, error messages become more obscure during compilation time,
  because if another header included by Pythia.h (e.g. HadronLevel.h) has an 
  error, then the compiler will fail when trying to compile HIUserHooks. If
  however only the relevant files were included, then HIUserHooks would fail to
  compile because of an error that is actually relevant for that class.
  Furthermore, this slows down compliation time, since HIUserHooks always
  needs to recompile.
  (Also mention this in CODESTYLE)

Declare methods and variables from PythiaStdlib as constexpr
